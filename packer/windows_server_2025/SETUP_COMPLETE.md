# ✅ Environment Setup Complete!

## 🎯 Summary of Changes

Your Packer Windows Server 2025 environment has been successfully configured with secure credential management using `.env` files.

### 📁 Files Created/Updated

#### New Files:
- ✅ `.env` - Environment variables with your actual credentials
- ✅ `.env.template` - Template for other users to copy
- ✅ `setup-env.sh` - Interactive setup script

#### Updated Files:
- ✅ `Taskfile.yml` - Added dotenv support and updated file checks
- ✅ Main `Taskfile.yml` - Added dotenv loading from packer directory
- ✅ `.gitignore` files - Ensured `.env` is ignored at both levels
- ✅ `README.md` - Updated with new setup instructions

#### Removed Files:
- ❌ `variables.secrets.auto.pkrvars.hcl` - Replaced with `.env` file

### 🔧 Configuration Fixed
- ✅ Updated file check to look for `generalize.ps1` (renamed script)
- ✅ Packer configuration already correctly references `generalize.ps1`
- ✅ Environment variable loading works from both project root and packer directory

## 🚀 How to Use

### For You (Current Setup):

# From packer directory
cd packer/windows_server_2025
task setup          # ✅ Passes all checks
task build          # Ready to build templates
```

### For Other Users:

cd packer/windows_server_2025
./setup-env.sh      # Interactive setup
# or manually:
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with credentials
